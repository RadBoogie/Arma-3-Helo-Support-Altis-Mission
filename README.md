# NATO Helicopter Support Mission - Altis Liberation

Based on the BIS Helo Support Multiplayer Missions, this scripted **single-player helicopter support mission** puts you in the cockpit, providing critical logistical support to NATO forces as they work to liberate Altis from CSAT occupation.

## Features
- **Fully Scripted Rewards System**: Earn rewards based on mission performance and war effort contributions.
- **Custom Audio**: Includes unique RWR sound and immersive CAS radio chatter.
- **Scripted Base Animations**: Dynamic repair, medical support, and ambient base activities.
- **Dynamic Objectives**: Support NATOâ€™s campaign to retake key locations across Altis.

## Situation
Five months ago, CSAT forces illegally occupied the island of Altis. The United Nations Security Council passed **Resolution 3211**, granting NATO combined forces the mandate to liberate the island. Allied forces have established a **Mulberry harbor at Ammolofi** for disembarking troops, vehicles, and materiel. Your helicopter squadron is tasked with providing **logistical air support** to the advancing NATO forces.

## Objectives
Support NATO ground forces in capturing the following key locations:
- **A - Syrta Camp**
- **B - Swindon Hill 217**
- **C - Ifestonia Substation**
- **D - Alt Bunker 90**
- **E - Koroni Checkpoint**
- **F - Athira Industrial District**

Overnight, special forces were inserted by air at **Alt Bunker 90** and **Swindon Hill 217** to secure a foothold for incoming allied forces.

## Mission
Your primary role is to provide **logistical air support** to NATO ground forces. With limited vehicles and manpower, the success of the campaign depends on your ability to:
- **Transport ground troops** to their objectives to maintain momentum.
- **Deliver transport vehicles** from Ammolofi Mulberries to troops departing from Home Plate.
- **Recover abandoned/damaged vehicles** (marked with yellow icons on the map) and return them to the Repair Shop for refurbishment.
- **Rearm, refuel, and repair your helicopter** at the Home Plate repair helipad to maintain operational readiness.
- **Heal or replace injured aircrew** at the Home Plate medical helipad.

### War Effort Contributions
Completing tasks such as transporting troops, recovering vehicles, and maintaining your helicopter will build **war effort points**. These points unlock:
- **Armed vehicle drops** for ground forces.
- **Close air support (CAS)** flights to aid the campaign.

Additional objectives will be assigned as the mission progresses.
