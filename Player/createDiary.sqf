Some tasks build war effort more quickly, for example successfully completing a Medevac mission 
will build a lot of war effort due to the morale boost it gives the troops.
<br/><br/>
Completing a Supply Request will earn more war effort than a transport request, but less than 
a Medevac.
<br/><br/>
Transport tasks only award war effort for delivering the troops to their requested objective. 
You may choose to deliver them to a different objective in order to sieze it but will not 
gain war effort. It is for you to decide whether the objective is worth more than the war effort.
<br/><br/>
Any enemy troops that you or your helo crew kill will contribute towards the war effort.
<br/><br/>
Your contribution towards the war effort can be seen in the bottom right corner of the screen."]

<br/><br/>
We are operating over a wide area with limited transport resources, your ability to 
transport ground troops to their objectives and build war effort will be key to the success of the campaign.
<br/><br/>
Based on your ability to complete assigned tasks and build war effort, reinforcements via armed 
vehicle drops and close air support flights will be made available.
<br/><br/>
Transport vehicles will be debarking at <marker name='ammolofiMulberries'>Ammolofi Mulberries</marker>, 
airlifting these to troops leaving <marker name='homePlateMarker'>Home Plate</marker> will contribute 
towards the war effort and get friendly troops to their objectives more quickly.
<br/><br/>
Because vehicles are in short supply, friendly groups will mark abandoned and damaged vehicles 
on the map with yellow icons. Transport these back to the <marker name='homePlateRepairShopMarker'>Repair Shop</marker> 
for repair, this will contribute to the war effort.
<br/><br/>
Rearming, refuelling and repairing your helo at the <marker name='homePlateRepairPadMarker'>Home Plate 
repair helo pad</marker> will contribute to the war effort.
<br/><br/>
Your injured aircrew can be healed or replaced at the <marker name='homePlateMedicalPadMarker'>Home 
Plate medical helo pad</marker> , this will also contribute towards the war effort.
<br/><br/>
Other objectives will be tasked to you as the mission progresses."]
